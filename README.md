# **Courses**

A list of undergraduate and graduate level courses relevant to physiological data analysis.
<br></br>

## **Elementary Statistics**

### [Stat 414 - UPenn](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/)

A well compiled, basic course on probability theory: random variables, distributions, etc. From UPenn.

### [Stat 415 - UPenn](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/)

After probability theory, a course on sampling from distributions and estimation of parameters, central limit theorum. If you don't know what _iid_ means, this is the place to start.

## **Elementary Timeseries Analysis**

Courses relevant to the anlaysis of physiological signals. Most of them are from the same youtube channel: [Mike X Cohen (MXC)]()

### [Analysis of Neural Timeseries 1 (ANTS1)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0OLiymPak0t1moK3sn4Sl1seXlEOPHT): Mike Cohen

A introductory playlist by Mike Cohen on the basics of timeseries analysis from an EEG perspective. Ideal for those unfamiliar with basics of ANTS.

### [Analysis of Neural Timeseries 2 (ANTS2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0OLiymPak2jxGCbWrcgmXUtt9Lbjj_A): Mike Cohen

A slightly more involved playlist consisting of videos on spectral analysis and their fundamentals. For anyone interested in learning concepts such as fourier and wavelet transforms, the principles behind and their applications, along with common mistakes.


### [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0OLiymPak3n8N6u06qI0ZNf87N_0rnz): Mike Cohen

A playlist consisting of five videos explaining the essential fundamentals of linear algebra and its applications in data analysis.

### [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab): 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson)

An amazing playlist of conceptual and visual intuitions behind varius aspects of linear algebra. A must watch for someone looking for deeper understanding of the subject matter.
